This is a list of notes from the GINA bootcamp in June 2017 at UAF
There was a workshop on Github that I missed the first part of, but want to try to catch up for the later part.

Git repo - has a master branch - make changes in the master.
a Fork is a separate repository - they make changes
then there may be a pull request to the master to bring in changes from the fork

Branching is like this, but there is a new chain of commits in the branch within the same repository 
branching is uesful for an experimental feature that may not work. There can be branches being worked on by different people
and is going to be put back together.  Branches can be shared or are for sharing changes on master.  Forks are to make a totally 
separate copy of a code for use to use together. 

git branch will give the name of all branches that are local
git branch -r gives all names of braches on the remote repository. 

git checkout lets you switch between branches or start a new branch 

EX:
get branch testing_branch (creates new branch)
get checkout testing_branch (moves to new branch)
make a new file

git add  will add this to the repository
git commit with commit the changes

then git push will bring back to online (remote repo)?
